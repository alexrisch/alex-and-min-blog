One of the culinary highlights was our dinner at Boda, where we shared an assortment of traditional Thai dishes that were both comforting and packed with bold flavors. The atmosphere was lively, and each bite transported us to the bustling streets of Bangkok.

Another memorable experience was our lunch at the Lobster Shack. Sitting by the ocean, savoring a perfectly prepared lobster roll while watching the waves crash against the rocky shore, was an experience that truly epitomized our time in Maine.
